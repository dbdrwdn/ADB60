# Donegal-C

A fork of the [gingham keyboard by Yiancar](https://github.com/yiancar/gingham_pcb).

Modified by [gipetto](https://github.com/itsnoteasy/gingerham) to add ABNT2 layout and drop the I/O expander and vias.

Further modified and refined by [piit79](https://github.com/piit79/donegal-c) with the following improvements:

* Use USB-C instead of USB Mini
* Add support for more layouts:
  * Stepped/normal Caps Lock
  * Tsangan bottom row
  * Split spacebar (I/O pins shared with OLED)
* Drop Alps support (to avoid large switch pin holes)
* Add OLED support (I/O pins shared with split spacebar)
