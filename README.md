# Donegal-C, named after the tweed

A fork of the [gingham keyboard by Yiancar](https://github.com/yiancar/gingham_pcb).

Modified by [gipetto](https://github.com/itsnoteasy/gingerham) to add ABNT2 layout and drop the I/O expander and vias.

Modified by [piit79](https://github.com/piit79/donegal-c) to use USB-C instead of USB Mini.

Made with KiCad 5 nightly development build.
